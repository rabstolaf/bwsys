# Cluster Management Training Documents

This repository contains training documents for St. Olaf Cluster Management.

## First Steps

Do the following steps:

* You will be using an application called VirtualBox to create and manage your Virtual Machines. A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system - "a computer inside a computer". Download and install [**VirtualBox**](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

* Your Virtual Machine will need an Operating System, as all computers do. Download the [**Ubuntu 18.04 Server**](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.5/ubuntu-18.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso) ISO file. This is the operating system which will be used by your Virtual Machine. It is called Ubuntu and it is a Linux-type operating system. 

[Here is a document](resources/command_line_tips.md) that have a lot of cool shortcuts for using during and after your training. You can always come back to it in order to learn and remind yourself how to cruise on the command line.
