# Welcome!

## Intro

This training will take you through setting up a cluster ( a network of computers ) on your own personal laptop.
This document will give you an overview of what you will do in the training as well as a glossary of terms you should familiarize yourself with before moving on with the training.
The rest of the documents should be followed in order till document 5, after which the training branches off into specializations and you may choose what exactly you want to do ( or do all of them! ).
Throughout the training, **Google** will be your best friend but do not hesitate to ask Trainers for help in case you need any sort of help.
Have fun!

* Ability to write bash scripts
* Knowledge about Docker and containers


## Overview

1. Setup a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 18.04 running on it.
2. Configure networking on the VM to set it up as the headnode/server.
3. Learn shell scripting.
4. Install Docker and get used to working with containers.
5. Create a Docker image and configure it to act as your golden node.
6. Clone the Docker image to create a cluster of Docker containers running on your VM.

## First Steps

* Download and install **VirtualBox**
* Download **Ubuntu 18.04 Server** ISO file
